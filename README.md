The project is organized into key directions and files, each serving a specific purpose:

  

-  `data samples/`: Contains all the data that as input in prototype.

-  `docs/`: Contains all the documentations files such as Project Background and Elicitation Document.

-  `prototypes/`: Contains low fidelity and high fidelity files such as screens, mockups and source files.

-  `tests/`: Contains all the files related to user/system tests.

-  `ui/`: Contains all the images created for the prototype.
